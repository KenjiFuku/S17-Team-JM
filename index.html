		Types of requirement[edit]
Requirements are typically classified into types produced at different stages in a development progression, with the taxonomy depending on the overall model being used. For example, the following scheme was devised by the International Institute of Business Analysis in their Business Analysis Body of Knowledge[4] (see also FURPS and Types of requirements).

Architectural requirements
Architectural requirements explain what has to be done by identifying the necessary integration of systems structure and systems behavior, i.e., systems architecture of a system.
In software engineering, they are called architecturally significant requirements, which is defined as those requirements that have a measurable impact on a software system’s architecture.[5]
Business requirements
High-level statements of the goals, objectives, or needs of an organization. They usually describe opportunities that an organization wants to realise or problems that they want to solve. Often stated in a business case.
User (stakeholder) requirements
Mid-level statements of the needs of a particular stakeholder or group of stakeholders. They usually describe how someone wants to interact with the intended solution. Often acting as a mid-point between the high-level business requirements and more detailed solution requirements.
Functional (solution) requirements
Usually detailed statements of capabilities, behaviour, and information that the solution will need. Examples include formatting text, calculating a number, modulating a signal. They are also known as capabilities.
Quality-of-service (non-functional) requirements
Usually detailed statements of the conditions under which the solution must remain effective, qualities that the solution must have, or constraints within which it must operate.[6] Examples include: reliability, testability, maintainability, availability. They are also known as characteristics, constraints or the ilities.
Implementation (transition) requirements
Usually detailed statements of capabilities or behaviour required only to enable transition from the current state of the enterprise to the desired future state, but that will thereafter no longer be required. Examples include: recruitment, role changes, education, migration of data from one system to another.
